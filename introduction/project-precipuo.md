# Project prec√≠puo

The project aims at an intelligent health, for this reason several researches were made, and in them a common factor was found, THE HARDNESS OF OBTAINING A GOOD HEALTH, through this, we raise some factors that make this situation impossible:

* <mark style="background-color:purple;">**Sedentarism**</mark> - Today, sedentarism has gained strength, with a technological generation, where they spend hours and hours in front of a cell phone, computers or a television set. And with this excess of information, it has brought with it a certain exhaustion, both emotional through all the information gathered, and physical, as they adapt to remote positions, with high injury rates.
* I<mark style="background-color:purple;">**nsomnia**</mark> - A major driver of high rates of depression, insomnia has increasingly increased, Lack of sleep is more common in adults and psychiatric patients. Varied studies from a global perspective find that the prevalence of sleep deprivation is evident in about 30% of the world's population - with some countries recording cases as high as 50% to 60%. Among the many pressing problems that come with continued sleep deprivation include long-term health conditions such as heart disease and failure, weak immune system, high blood pressure, kidney disease, depression, diabetes, obesity.
* <mark style="background-color:purple;">**Financial situation:**</mark> The financial factor can have its direct interference on a healthy health, because many people associate an awkward time, where they do not generate profits.

The Smart health, thinking about all these issues and analyzing the scenario, has solved all these problems in a single application. It will bring information about good nutrition, tips for healthy sleep, exercise modalities and clearly all of this linked to financial benefits. An addendum to the benefits of the tips will be delivered by using the smart health app for a certain amount of time and acquiring the SHR (Smart Health Reward) token.

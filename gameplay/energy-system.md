# Energy System

After purchasing an nft from the smart health collection, you will receive a daily amount of energy, in which you will have the maximum time available to earn SHT for the day. However, if you run out of energy in the middle of the activity, you can continue the practice, although you will not earn it after that available time.

In the initial phase of the app, after purchasing an nft from the smart health collection, the user will receive 60 energy points daily, which is basically 60 minutes of practice (1 energy = 60 minutes):

* [x] 10 energy every 3 hours

Only one energy buyback per day will be allowed.\
\
&#x20;Example:

* [x] If you have 1 nft smartwatch you will have 60 energy/day, 10 energy every 3 hours and a maximum of 1 energy buyback
* [x] If you have 3 smartwatch NFT, you will have 180 energy/day, 30 energy every 3 hours and a maximum of 3 energy repurchases.

Addendum: After you press Start, the application will start timing at least the first 10 minutes. This means that even if you press Start and hang up 5 minutes later, your runtime will still be deducted by 10 minutes; you only have 50 minutes left.

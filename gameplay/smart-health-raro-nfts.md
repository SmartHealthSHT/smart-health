# Smart Health raro NFT's

The rare smart health NFT's is one of the main factors that decide how many tokens you can get. The rare level of the nfts ( sneaker nft, smartwatch nft and eye cover nft) affects the attributes of the NFts, which are:

* Efficiency: determines the rate at which you will earn $SHT tokens. Higher efficiency will result in more earnings.
* Durability: determines the health deterioration rate of your NFT (nft sneakers, nft smartwatch and nft eye patch). More durability will result in slower health deterioration. The higher the level or quality of NFTs, the higher the repair cost.
* Luck: determines the frequency and quality of a Lucky Item drop.

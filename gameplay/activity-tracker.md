# âš” Activity tracker

All activities performed by the user, will be monitored through the application via tracker, where the user starts and ends its manual position. We will use motion sensor, GPS and especially heart rate (BPM), which accurately tracks the data of the developed activities. In the beta version of the app we will have 6 activities (cycling, running, walking, resting and sleeping, there will be a lowering of the heart rate, but the SHT token will be generated with a smaller amount. We will show the following data in the app:

* [x] Distance
* [x] Time
* [x] Speed
* [x] Heart rate (BPM)
* [x] Elevation
* [x] Optical detector (SONO)
